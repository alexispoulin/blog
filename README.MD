##BLOG - General info

This blog is a project from me and my girlfriend about our 3 month trip to south-east Asia. During our time over there, we consulted a lot of blog website just like ours while trying to find information. This is our take on giving out the most of our knowledge from our experience. I hope you enjoy the content. We expect to complete this project before January 2020.

I spend a lot of time editing the CSS style as well as creating my own classes. Built some Javascript along the way in order to acheive what I had in mind, such has sticky 2nd navigation bar and some issue I had with the main navigation bar click (Special thanks to Mr. Montambeault for the help!)
