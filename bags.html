                            <h2> <br>Packing for a long trip<br></h2> 
                            <p>
 

We decided to pack light, and to add item to our luggage while traveling if needed. So we only have one big backpack (60 liter) and one small school size backpack for the both of us. But let's be real, it’s summer clothing. You don’t need a winter jacket and 4 pair of shoes, it's easier to pack light that way. We packed one good pair of running shoes and a comfortable pair of flip flops (I insist on the comfortable part). We also had one hoody each and one pair of long pants (mainly for the planes ride which tend to by pretty well climatised…). The rest was summer clothes, short, dress, top tank, t-shirt and dress. (to be honest, most of the clothing are mine….but I was incredibly happy to have dresses, even long one are often less warm than short). In the bag, there was also our toiletry items, like soap toothbrush and other. Don’t forget your swimsuit, 2-3 even because sand and sun are not kind to swimsuits… We also had our own towels but we didn’t bring reusable water bottle. You won’t use them, tap water is undrinkable. We use tap water for brushing our teeth most of the time without problem (expect Bali… we got a little sick….) but never drink it. Therefore, you have to buy plastic bottle all the time. 
<br>
<br>
You don’t need a lot of clothes, there’s laundry places everywhere and they are pretty cheap (in Bangkok it costs around 50 bath (2$) for a big basket of clothing). We also hand wash a few items <a href="laundry.html">(Here’s more information about laundry) </a> 
<br>
<br>
Worse case scenario you need to buy more clothes and that's not what’s missing in Asia. If my 6.6 bear can find clothes you can for sure! And the clothes are also way cheaper there.

Our smaller backpack mainly contained our electronic (computer, tablet, readers and all chargers that come with those)
