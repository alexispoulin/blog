                            <h2><br>Convenience store in Thailand</h2>
                            <p>
<br>
<b>7/11</b>
<br>
They are everywhere! If you haven’t seen a 7/11, I am not sure you have been to Thailand. They also have everything, from water to food, to tissue. Each of them have different offers, bigger one are more like grocery store and smaller one have the necessity. But no matter the size you are always sure to find water and snack! The most important thing about 7/11 is their selection of warm food. They have a cold section with a selection of sandwich once you pay it, they will cook your sandwich for you in a panini grill. (my all time favorit is the hot dog sausage grill cheese - 30 Baht). They also have a freezer where you can find a selection of meal, like curry, rice, chicken dish that they will warm up for you and give you the proper utensils. According to Alexis they have one of the best curry he ever tasted! (From what we saw, locals seam to buy a lot from that section) The pricing, apart from their house brand is a bit more expensive than in a grocery store (Grocery store a pretty rare) but by 10-30 bath ( example nutella in 7/11 cost 115 bath and at the grocery store (super cheap) it was 95 bath)
<br>
<br>
<i>Bonus point: When you buy in promotion items or for each 50 baht spent they give you a 7/11 sticker that you can use as currency. I have a collection…. great, cute small souvenir if you want my opinion.</i>

<br>
<b>Super cheap</b>
<br>
Like the name says it’s super cheap…. they have everything but mostly can and non perishable items. If you are addicted to Nutella like me, it’s the best place to buy some but it’s behind the counter (it’s an expensive item for Thailand and for us it cost around the same amount than in Canada) 
<br>
<br>
If you want fresh produce, the best way is always to find a local market and buy your veggies, fruits and meat there (no you won’t get sick from the meat, the turnaround of their product is way faster then our’s so their product is always fresh) They normally are open in the morning but there also a market at night, hours and days of opening vary from place to place. 
<br>
<br>
<b>Corner shop</b> 
<br>
Every corner has it’s tiny shop where oncle joe sell a few snack and juice. They are really small and very pack with stuff but a great last resort.  There is A LOT of these shops.
