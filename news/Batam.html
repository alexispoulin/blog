                                    There is not many pictures in this news post, but trust me, it's worth reading.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    It’s time for the boat story, which is 4 days of our trip but needs to be told in
                                    two parts. Part one leaving singapore and going to batam. To leave singapore, it’s
                                    pretty easy you just have to take a ferry and an hour later your are in batam. <a
                                        href="../usefultips/fromto5.html">(If you want more detail on how to take the
                                        ferry in Singapore to go to batam click here)</a> And no, we couldn’t just jump
                                    from singapore directly to Jakarta/indonesia wich was our final destination (At
                                    least the information we got from internet told us it was not possible...) So to
                                    Batam we went, leaving was fine, the boat ride was nice but the arrival… oh boy. I
                                    thought I would never be pushed through immigration by another passenger, but now I
                                    can check it off my bucket list. A man literally grab my arm to push me toward the
                                    immigration officer because I wasn’t walking there fast enough for his taste. To be
                                    clear we were already in line and I was next. That was a really chaotic arrival at
                                    least I thought that until we arrived in Jakarta but that’s another story. Once we
                                    passed immigration which was pretty easy <a href="../usefultips/visa.html">(See here
                                        for more information about visa in Indonesia)</a>... too easy... but we will
                                    only learn that a few weeks later when we will try to leave Indonesia. I promise
                                    that was the last cliffhanger. After the arrival it was time to go to our hotel, it
                                    was old, but honestly after the hotel in singapore it looked like a 5 star hotel, I
                                    may be exaggerating a little bit…

                                    <br>
                                    Once we settled in, it was time to look for food and that’s when we got our first
                                    bad experience has tourists. We first went to a grocery store and full up on snack
                                    for the boat ride, everything was cheap so we kinda went overboard and bough way too
                                    many sweet snacks. (Caramel popcorn…..) After that we headed to the restaurant next
                                    door. That’s where someone with a very serious face tried to sell us a very tiny
                                    piece of fish for 35$CAD… No it wasn’t a high end restaurant or even a nice one. So
                                    we started laughing, closed the menu and left. The second restaurant actually tried
                                    to sell it to us for 45$. I wouldn’t even pay that in canada… I am not about to
                                    spend that kind of money in a street stall when I am pretty sure there’s rats in the
                                    kitchen. (NO that’s not a free insulte a few minutes earlier on our way there, I saw
                                    two rats fighting in the street) So we got back to the hotel without food,
                                    thankfully we had grab and on our phone. Fortunately, they can’t know we are white
                                    on grab. So the fish in the same restaurant when ordered online suddenly costed 2$
                                    ... We were so pissed that we order Mcdonald… We didn’t want to give them our money
                                    so we chose the most american thing available. And yes we did that for the 2 days we
                                    stayed in batam. <a href="../usefultips/grabfood.html">(Here’s more information
                                        about grab food)</a>
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    After that infuriating experience, we order a grab to go a different part of the
                                    island in order to get our tickets. We stayed close to the departure point, but for
                                    some odd reason you had to buy the ticket 30 minutes away from there. So we got
                                    there and we saw the lovely sticker of Visa and Mastercard on the door and we
                                    naively told ourselves this is going to be easy. We were wrong very very wrong. We
                                    needed 2 millions Indonesian Rupiah cash and only had 300 000 in our wallet. So we
                                    got back in the grabcar and negotiated with the driver again (We already negotiate
                                    with him to wait for us outside while we were paying the ticket… off the app of
                                    course) Then, we asked him to drive us to the airport where we could withdraw cash
                                    and come back to the ticketing office... no big deal. (The airport was 2 minutes
                                    away) which he did but the ATM at the airport didn’t work with our cards… none of
                                    the 5 ATM over there worked with our cards... that’s where panic started getting to
                                    us. <a href="../usefultips/atm.html">(Here’s more information about ATM when you
                                        travel)</a> We didn’t want to stay longer on that island and to boat only leaves
                                    once a week, on wednesday. We are not staying one more week!! We hopped back in the
                                    grab car and kindly ask/negotiate with him to drive us around town in search of a
                                    working ATM. The man was incredibly kind and helped us. Our next stop was a bank
                                    hoping that they will be able to help us, unfortunately they just referred us to
                                    another ATM. First try, Alexis card didn’t work, second try in an other ATM his card
                                    didn’t work but as he was trying his second ATM I tried the first one thinking It
                                    won’t work since we have the same account. But for some reason the ATM liked me and
                                    gave me ¾ of the amount we needed. That’s where my amazing bear got a great idea.
                                    Use our remaining Thai baht, transfer them in Indonesian Rupiah via the airport
                                    transfer counter and with that we should have the full amount for the tickets. And
                                    it work!!! We were finally able to buy our ticket to leave for Jakarta.

                                    After a stressful 3 hours, we were back in our hotel. (For the record, in front of
                                    our hotel there was a working ATM. We just didn’t wanted to make the trip back to
                                    the hotel and back to the ticket office twice). In our trip around the island, it’s
                                    important to mention how it looked like. It was a bit odd, there was huge hotel
                                    complexe with themes and hundreds of rooms, but they all seemed run down and empty.
                                    It’s seemed odd and partly explained the eagerness of the restaurant owner to sell
                                    us overpriced food. Finally, the time came for us to get to the docks.
