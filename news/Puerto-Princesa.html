                                <p>

                                    Getting to the island of Palawan is a complex affair. We had to take 2 different
                                    planes at pretty odd hours. Fortunately for us, customs in the Philippines were
                                    pretty easy, we basically got there and they stamped our passport. <a
                                        href="../usefultips/visa.html">(Here’s more
                                        information about visa in the Philippines)</a> Once we got to Puerto Princesa
                                    airport,
                                    the biggest problem was to get to our hotel. Until then, we bought a SIM cards at
                                    the airport and once we were outside, we tried to call a Grab car. The first step
                                    went well (Here's more information about sim card in the Philippines) but the second
                                    step… well almost got Alexis mad. We tried the application, but it wasn’t working.
                                    It was like if we didn’t have internet access. After a long process we determined
                                    that it wasn’t the internet but the application that wasn’t working. We learned
                                    later on that Grab doesn’t exist on the island of Palawan. Yes there was a Grab
                                    publicity in the airport but the app, is not active on the island… Once we gave up
                                    on using Grab, we went in search of a Taxi which was more complicated than we
                                    expected from an airport! We only saw tuk-tuk.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Normally tuk-tuk are the most expensive option, so we prefer to avoid them and go
                                    with a taxi. Eventually we found a taxi! And after negotiation, we got a decent
                                    price for the 10 minutes ride (250 PHP - 6.50$ CAD). The initial price was about 400
                                    PHP and we were the only one in the entire place that were seeking a taxi. With more
                                    than 5 taxi outside looking at us, we thought they were over charging for the 10
                                    minute ride. A bit later, we also learned that there’s only like 5 taxi in Puerto
                                    Princesa… AKA the whole island. In Palawan, people get around in tuk-tuk or small
                                    bus. We learned our lesson, so we ditched grab and start using tuk-tuk!

                                    Since we have been traveling all night and haven’t had breakfast, our first mission
                                    was to eat. Fortunately, the hotel had a few flyer’s of nearby restaurant and we
                                    were able to order (Online actually, not with grab). That day we basically slept and
                                    we rented a bike to prepare to go around for the next day. It was Alexis’ first time
                                    on a manual motorbike (the automatic models were just way more expensive). I need to

                                    the clutch correctly with his flip flops.

                                    Finally, we met our first Philippines beach. We ended up in the middle of nowhere on
                                    a beach where there was no one. The beach was really beautiful, but the best thing
                                    about this beach trip was the fish! Once we got to the beach we got accosted by a
                                    few street vendor and after telling them we were not interested about 6 times...
                                    they went away… From here, there was this lady that sold fresh fish cooked on a
                                    grill. That fish alone was worth the whole trip to the Philippines (okay I may be
                                    exaggerating a bit but the fish was bloody good ;) )

                                    For our last day in Puerto Princesa we went visiting the famous “Puerto Princesa
                                    Subterranean River National Park”. One of the reason the island of Palawan is
                                    renowned is for the 11 miles water cavern that’s been voted one of the 7 wonders of
                                    nature. To visit this incredible cavern, you have to book a tour. You can go to the
                                    cavern and buy a ticket over there, but that means a 2-3h trip on a bike going and
                                    needs to do the same for coming back. Your butt may be mad at you for this
                                    decision.. The tour cost 1200 PHP (30$ CAD) each and included pickup/drop off at the
                                    hotel, the cavern entry price and a meal. The thing they don’t tell you is that when
                                    you book this trip, they will force to go to 2 other activities before visiting the
                                    cavern… For those you will have to pay an extra and they will pressure you to do
                                    them. We didn’t do them and inform the hotel of the scam afterwards (it was their
                                    recommendations and we were mad since they promised us that there was no extra
                                    charge).

                                    Anyway after 30 minutes the bus driver got us to the diner place (buffet style) and
                                    then after diner we visited the actual cavern! To visit the cavern you have to take
                                    2 different boat.

                                    The first one got us to the part of the island where the cavern
                                    starts then a second one was to visit the cavern. If you are claustrophobic, you
                                    don’t have to worry the cavern is pretty big! Immense in fact. As the guide paddle
                                    (yes paddle, no motor in the cavern and no noise to avoid disturbing those living in
                                    it) he will point you different rock formation.

                                    We also had an audio guide that
                                    explain various element about the cavern. Tourists are only allow through the first
                                    1.5 kilometer after that, only expert with special permissions are allowed further.
                                    At the point of turning back there no more light from outside, it’s pitch black, a
                                    bit scary if you want my opinion.

                                    The day after visiting the cavern, it was time for us to move to the town of El
                                    Nido. Now if you haven’t noticed yet... Every name are in spanish, but don’t get
                                    confuse, nobody speaks spanish. They only inherited the spanish names and the
                                    religions from the spanish colonisation. Now to get to El Nido you have to take to
                                    bus. You can get there with a motor bike if you really wish, but it’s a 7h drive…
                                    good luck!

                                    Remember that I told you that the transfer from Probolinggo to Bali was a bumpy
                                    ride. Well... I retract my comment, it was a peaceful drive compared to the driving
                                    <i>philippines style</i>. We literally had to grab onto our seats to stay put and
                                    even then, I had problems not jumping around. It was so horrible that it just
                                    provided hilarity. I laugh most of the ride It felt like an unrealistic ride. It
                                    could be possible that a jammed packed minibus full of people was that crazy. But it
                                    was, and we were sore the next day just because we tried for 7h to stay put on our
                                    seats.<a href="../usefultips/fromto11.html">( Here’s more information about the ride

                                    Once we arrived at El Nido terminus, there was no cell service and it was a bit
                                    outside off the town center (1 km) but the tuk-tuk drivers are very nice and will
                                    tell you how far is your hotel. The town is pretty much hotels and restaurant. Don’t
                                    blink too hard cause you are gone miss it. We then proceeded to get to our hotel
                                    that like the rest of the town was at the foot of a steep montagne.
