                                    A Chaotic transfer

                                    After visiting all of the beautiful scenery around Probolinggo, we were ready to get
                                    to Bali. After a few research we found that to get to Bali the easiest route was to
                                    take a bus that will take us directly to our Hotel in Bali. (We could have taken the
                                    train and then the ferry by ourselves and then find a transportation to our hotel in
                                    Bali
                                    but that was 1: more expensive and 2: way more complicated). So we just book a bus.
                                    Unfortunately, the bus only left at 5 pm so we knew we would arrive in the middle of
                                    the night when we booked the trip.
                                    <a href="../usefultips/fromto9.html"> (Here more information about going to Bali
                                        from
                                        Probolinggo)</a>
                                    A few minutes after we booked we received a text informing us that the
                                    bus we just booked wouldn't leave at 5PM as promised but between 8-9PM like all
                                    of the other company. We were pretty piested about that but we didn’t have any other
                                    option. I guessed that in the high season all the busses are booked so they usually
                                    leave on time. But in low season they will push the departure time until the bus is
                                    full. Because of that, we ended up having a pretty long time to wander around
                                    Probolinggo with our bags.

                                    The hotel kindly agreed to keep our bags until the bus arrives but we could not stay
                                    in the room. Therefore, we went in a cafe and played chest for hours.

                                    We also tried Indonesien massage which after two days of extreme motorbiking it was
                                    pretty relaxing and fun. I specified “fun” because all of us laugh during the entire
                                    hour. (Don’t get me wrong, they were laughing more than us). Let me explain, the way
                                    this place was set up, it was like each massage table were separated by curtain and
                                    the curtain allowed just enough space for someone to walk around the table. The
                                    thing they didn’t consider while building this place was a 6 foot 7 bear. So
                                    basically Alexis feet were pointing in someone else message area which cause
                                    hilarity anytime someone moved.

                                    Eventually, the bus came to pick us up and to Bali we went! Our original plan was to
                                    sleep in the bus, no biggie, sleeping in a car is my most developed skill. The thing
                                    I didn't take into consideration was that the Indonesian roads have more bump and
                                    crack than anywhere else and that the motivation of the driver to race against the
                                    wind to get to bali. At one point I just stopped looking outside, he kept changing
                                    lane and overtake other cars at a scary speed for the road conditions. The total
                                    trip took a total of 12 hours and that included taking a ferry between Java to Bali
                                    and being dropped off at our hotel.

                                    </div>

                                    We arrived at our hotel at 8AM, exhausted and very happy we booked the hotel for the
                                    day before (that way we didn’t have to wait until 11h to be allowed in the room. Of
                                    course, the first thing we did was sleeping since sleeping in the bus was an
                                    impossible task. Once we woke up, we realised that we forgot so many thing in
                                    Probolinggo. Fortunately we did not forget nothing important but just enough to make
                                    us mad at ourselves. It was the first time we forgot anything is a room! The weird
                                    thing is that in indonesia they check your room before you leave so they should have
                                    seen the things we forgot. Lesson of that day, don’t rely on someone else you we
                                    don’t want to forget things.

                                    The room we rented in Bali had a small kitchen and this time it was 100% working!

                                        accomodation in Asia)</a> So our first mission was to
                                    find a grocery store or a market to find fresh food. <a
                                        href="../usefultips/foodstoreindonesia.html">(Here’s more information about
                                        grocery store in Indonesia)</a> It was a pretty easy task since the area we
                                    stayed in
                                    had a few butcher so we were able to have fresh meat and fish. Also, a very popular
                                    thing in Indonesia are spice packs so you have different bags of flavor and it’s
                                    easier to buy that than multiple spice in order to be able to make flavorful meals.

                                    The next thing we did in Bali was the obvious renting of a motorbike! At this point,
                                    we weren’t really close to any beach so we hopped on the bike on went to see the
                                    sea. The one thing we didn’t expect was the amount of traffic in Bali! No matter
                                    where we went there was traffic!
