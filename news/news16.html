                                    Few things to remember about Bali; it’s an island, depending on where you stay on
                                    the island it’s more or less touristy, but no matter where you go, there will be
                                    tourist. Indonesia is Muslim country except for Bali, they have a religion closer to
                                    buddhism. Something we observed and got told about a lot, Bali have a “mafia”
                                    problem. If you want to do something you will need to pay. If you want to get to a
                                    beach, even if it’s a public beach, someone will have set up a table to charge
                                    “entrance” fee for tourists. We heard a few horror story regarding the volcano and
                                    being forced to visit with a guide, but since we visited Bromo, we skipped it. From
                                    what I could deduce, Bali is still a very beautiful place but it’s no longer the
                                    “traveler” lost paradise. It’s more like a big resort crowded with an endless amount
                                    of tourist and motorbike.

                                    <br>
                                    Now on the bright side, we stayed for a very long time in Bali we even extended our
                                    stay <a href="../usefultips/extendingstay.html">(Here's more info about extending
                                        your stay)</a>. It was the perfect place to just
                                    relax and enjoy the sun a little bit. Also, since our accommodation had a kitchen we
                                    were able to cook and enjoy local food market.

                                    During our stay we mainly visited different beaches around the island, just because,
                                    why not try them all! One of them was pretty impressive since it had deep dark sand
                                    that was almost glittery.

                                    Apart from biking around in traffic, we also visited a temple lost in the middle of
                                    the forest. We were really happy to have found that place since it was empty. The
                                    road to get there was incredible and once we arrived there was that amazing feeling
                                    of being lost in the juggle.

                                    Nature had slowly taken back its right over the place. It was still a place of
                                    worship where nature and religion coexisted marvelously.

                                    To visit this temple they
                                    lent us (with the ticket price 40 000 rupee) traditional clothes to wear in the
                                    compound. I got a lot of picture of Alexis, that to my delight, had to wear a weird
                                    hat. The mixt with his banana shirt was incredible.

                                    The most important thing that happen for us in Bali wasn’t to rest, the beach or the
                                    temple visit, it was that we found what we were searching for. We left Canada not
                                    only because we wanted to visit Asia, but also because we wanted more. More from
                                    life, a different life, it was something we didn’t know how to get and we needed
                                    some time to detach ourselves from our routine and the monotony of the everyday
                                    life. We were at a point in our lives that we finished school and were working but
                                    we weren’t going toward a goal and we needed one. That’s what we found in Bali, I
                                    say Bali, yet we have been thinking about it since the beginning of our trip. We
                                    left Canada telling ourselves that we are traveling until we are broke or until we
                                    found what we were looking for. And since we have reached our goals we booked our
                                    plane tickets back to Canada for a month later. We were eager to move forward with
                                    our new goals.

                                    We stayed about 2 weeks in Bali and then left for the Philippines. I don’t know if
                                    you remember that I told you that when we got in Indonesia, it was too easy and it
                                    will cause us problem later. Well the later was now! We got a plane ticket to get to
                                    Palawan <a href="../usefultips/fromto10.html">(Here’s more information about how get
                                        from Bali to Palawan)</a> and the
                                    problems came once we got to the immigration at the Bali’s airport. Both of us went
                                    through immigration at the same time but at a different booth. The immigration
                                    officer opened my passport saw the stamp and told me that it wasn’t readable (which
                                    was through the immigration guy in Batam and they did a pretty shaky job…) He could
                                    not read if I stayed more than a month since we go in the 9th and got out on 6th of
                                    the next month, the exact date was pretty important. I proceed to explained to him
                                    that the custom officer in Batam wrote in my boyfriend passport the proper date. He
                                    then asked me to go get him. As I was walking toward Alexis he turn to me a said my
                                    custom officer want to see your passport right now. We started feeling a bit
                                    trapped. None of our passport where stamped correctly and the custom officer didn’t
                                    believe us that their coworker in Batam wrote directly in our passport the date.
                                    (over the stamp). At that moment they proceeded to call their supervisor. When the
                                    supervisor arrived, he asked us if we had proof of our arrival. Fortunately for us
                                    we had an e-ticket on our phones. The supervisor then ask us to follow him and told
                                    us to sit on a chair and left the room with our passport and our phone. We sat there
                                    for 10 very very very long minutes. Eventually the guy came back told us there’s no
                                    record of our entry in the country but since we had proof of entry and something
                                    resembling a stamp we were good to go. We were not trying to smuggle in the country
                                    since we were getting out… Therefore, he recommend us to ask for a second stamp if
                                    the first one is blurry… Well I don’t know if you remember, but the Batam custom
                                    were a bit pushy and felt like an expedited process. So we probably got the Batam’s
                                    officers yelled at. Nevertheless, we were allowed to go take our flight to the
                                    philippine’s !
