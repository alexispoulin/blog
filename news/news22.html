                                    We left Da Nang in the morning to get to Ho Chi Minh, everything went smoothly.
                                    (Here more information about the flight for Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh). As we were
                                    landing, Alexis prepared himself for his interview. It was a stressful process to
                                    pass an interview through webcam but he did an amazing job (and also got the job
                                    hehehe)

                                    For our last day of our trip we decided to go shopping in a huge market. And for
                                    once we were not hunted by the fact that we would have to transport everything for a
                                    long period so we bought a few things! I treated myself with a new purse, the old
                                    one was in a pretty bad shape. Alexis also got a bag and we bought a vietnamiens tea
                                    set. We have a small collection of tea set so why not one more… After one last Pho
                                    it was time to leave vietnam and to begging the next step in our lives back home.

                                    But first we need to get home! This time it was an 24h trip, we had 3 flight and
                                    pass through Korea and the United State. We left Ho Chi Minh early in the morning,
                                    surprisingly there was a pretty long queue at the counter. A lot of people seems to
                                    travel with a lot of package like if they were bringing back stuff to sell. We took
                                    some extra steps for the two first flight and reserved seat with extra leg room for
                                    alexis. All the flight went very well (here’s the details about the flights), the
                                    first one we event get smoked salmon during the meal. I got to say, Qatar airway was
                                    nice but Delta wasn’t far behind. After the first one we landed in korea and met a
                                    pretty nice robot. Yes, Robot, he was roaming the airport and take picture with
                                    tourist. After a quick meal and 4 hours of wait we were back in a plan to

                                    amazing news that alexis got the job he passed an interview for. Side immigration
                                    story, a woman decided that it was a good idea to skip the line, go under the rope
                                    and skip the scanning. So as you can guess, that wasn’t a good idea and a butch of
                                    us custom officer started yelling at the lady and they froze the entire custom until
                                    the women was controlled. So she tried to skip waiting and lines and she probably go
                                    stock over there for a few hours… Don’t go under the ropes at airport… it won’t be
                                    shorter.

                                    Once we got to our gate we start receiving a lot of message from friends in canada
                                    asking if our flight was delayed and if we were going to be able to get back to
                                    night. We king of didn’t understand. The flight was not delayed and the weather seem
                                    fine until they send us picture of the weather in Montréal…. So they had a pretty
                                    bad storm and part of the province lost electricity for days! A few minutes later we
                                    received a series a picture of tree that had fled of in the street in Alexis
                                    hometown…. We made a few call and my parents where we were going still had
                                    electricity and the flight wasn’t delay so we were able to get back home that night
                                    with no problem.

                                    Around midnight we finally landed in Montréal, back home at last. But that’s not the
                                    end of our trip yet, we still had to get to my parents house. So first we went to
                                    pick up our car that was park at my grandparents house 30 minutes away from the
                                    airport. Then we headed for my parents house. Of course as good canadien we stopped
                                    on the way for some Tim horton…. Well, actually we stopped 3 times, not because we
                                    needed a indecent amount of coffee but just because the first 2 place didn’t had
                                    electricity…. 3h later we were at my parents house. A quick shower (god i missed
                                    Canadian warm water stability) we were in our own bed! Well actually more like
                                    mattress but still that was an incredible feeling. We never fell asleep that fast.
