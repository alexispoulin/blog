Once we woke up from what seemed to be the best and most needed nap of our lives, we got out of the room in search of food. But first the room was perfect, it was clean, big, had a fridge, a boiler (came handy for noodle cup), a T.V and a couch. All that for 21$ per night! The first 2 days we slept, mainly because I caught a cold in the plane and had a fever. 
<br>
<br>
There is where the 7/11 saved our lives (I am slightly dramatic but still). Yes they have the usual convenience store things like, snack, water, juice and ramen, but they also have that nice selection of grill cheese sandwich. That whole section is refrigerated and once you pay it, they make the grill cheese for you, so it’s warm and perfect. I lived out of that and chicken noodle soup for 2 days. (don’t worry once the cold was over we started tasting local delicacy) But I am serious, 7/11 are magical lands where our poor western stomac could take a break from the spiciness of the local food. <a href="foodstore.html">(Here’s more information about 7/11 and how it can save you trip to thailand)</a>

The first time we went out of the room for other reason than search of food, it was to visit the Princess Mother Parc which was a nice small parc near our apartment and for us the perfect way to get used to the heat. The parc was lovely and it even had a small museum explaining the life of the Princess mother. (which seems like a really nice women. It shows how she dedicated her life to help and improve the quality of life of the citizen of her country. They really love her for it and called her the people’s mother)

From there, the heat wasn’t that bad, so the next day we kept exploring around our accommodation, learning where we were, how the street worked and how to order coffee (they have really good coffee everywhere and if you are lucky it will come with a moo moo on it - see picture)
<br>

                            <div class="imgblog">

 We had had a few mishap ordering food that was way too spicy or ordering food they refused to serves us, for good reason since it was probably way too hot for us or too weird. (when a waiter tells you not to eat something or insist you eat one specific plate, thrust them they know….) We eventually used an app that translates pictures to get around menu better <a href="communicating.html">(Here’s a link to more information about communicating in Asia)</a> 
 <br>
 <br>
 On day 5, we decided to go shopping to the MBK center, what an experience! It’s 6 floor of condensed stands, selling a mixt of new and old item. I was happy because I was shopping and Alexis was happy because he could negotiate the hell out of everything. To get there, we decided to walk for 1h (yeah again, I promise, we learn eventually) Walking 1h would probably have been fine but unfortunately we had to take the ferry to get to the MBK center (there’s a big river in the middle of Bangkok and not a lot of bridge… <a href="ferry.html">(Here’s more info about ferry)</a> But since it was sunday… the ferry was closed and the 1h walk quickly transformed into a 2h walk… It would have cost us around 200 bath (8$) to use a taxi. After 1h30 walk in the heat Gabby gave up and we took a cab for the last few kilometers. We finally arrived at the mall, ate and started wandering around the giant maze that is the MBK center.

 I describe it has a shopping trip but seriously it’s more like a cultural experience. If you are traveling with a giant man (or any non thai-size man) every tailor in the center will try to stop you, shake your hand and try to sell you a suit, so we got followed around by many hopeful tailors (every tailor store at least tried to talk with Alexis). We knew that center existed before we left Canada and purposely didn’t bought some article for our trip from canada in the hope of finding them for cheaper there. 
 <br>
 <br>
 We ended up with one electric rasoir (600 baht) (Alexis’s beard needed handling), a sewing kit (50 bath), a pillow shape like a dinosaur (150 bath) (I am 5 and aware of it) and few other nik nak. Our day ended with a good haul and tired feet, we always underestimated the amount of walk involved in shopping, especially when the shopping center has 6 huge floor… </p>

                            We bought our ticket around 6 weeks in advance for the trip. First, we look on google for tickets the price looked good but continued our search just to be sure. For us Canadian it’s a 20h flight minimum… well you tries to do an informed purchase. I ended up on youtube on travelDan’s vlog about different airline. He swear that Qatar airway was one of the best and it was also the airline with the most leg room (Traveling with a 6 foot 6 bear that’s important). So we decided to book directly for the airline and bonus point it was 100$ cheaper than the price we found on google! <a href="fromto1.html">(If you want to know the detail of the flight, seat, meals and other please click here)</a>

                <br>
So we left Montréal around noon and started our 30h trip (yeah 30h cause it’s cheaper that way…) with a 1h45 flight to philadelphie on American airline. Once we arrived in philadelphie we had to get out of the terminal and back in the check our ticket at the Qatar airway counter (we learned later that you can do that a the gate 1-2h before the flight but in our case we wanted to secure the emergency exit seat <a href="fromto1.html">(click here to know more about Qatar emergency exit seat policy)</a>
And up we went on our 11h flight to Qatar (yes the country, all of the company flight layover in Qatar) and thanks to some night advil it went like a charm. (I highly recommend sleeping pill on long flight it guaranty a good sleep and therefore a short flight) 
                <br>

For our layover, we were advise by a flight attendant not to get out of the airport...we didn’t have the time to but if you do have the time it’s not a recommended option. 
                <br>
                <br>
We finally arrived in Bangkok a 5h am local time, at the Bangkok airport you can use the regular lane to pass true immigration (ask the staff they are very helpful) For immigration since we are Canadian we have an automatic visa of 30 days <a href="immigration.html"> (and we need to fill out a immigration card, for more information about visa please click here)</a>. The immigration office take your finger print and that’s about it. They don’t really ask you question so no worry! 
                <br>
                <br>
Once we pass emigration it’s still a little too early to go to our AirBnb that we booked <a href="accomodation.html">(Here’s a link to a few useful site to book accommodation in Asia).</a>  So we start by getting cash at an ATM with our credit Card (we always use the credit card for cash it’s safer that way…) but you need cash you cannot pay with credit card in Thailand (almost no where..) After money it was time for internet connection! There’s a lot of internet provided (<a href=simcard.html"> here’s a link for more information.)</a> We got 15 G for around 20$ for 20 days not bad especially if you compare to Canadian price… It’s a bit more expensive to  get the plan and sim card at the airport but by 2-3 $. Finally time to eat breakfast witch didn’t look like one ! (For those going the the Bangkok international airport, go downstairs to eat, there’s a food court there. Way way cheaper than the upstairs restaurant. And yes we are going to feel like you are going in the wrong direction but it’s fine. Also they use ticket, so at the entrance of the food court you need to buy the ticket, then buy your meal.) In our case, we choosed soups and fruit shakes. The soup was good but I still have doubt about what was in it…  and the fruit shake well we had one almost everyday starting from there.

Now we have kill enough time and it’s time to go to our guest house in …… , it’s a less touristy area of Bangkok. We decided to take the train (Bangkok have the BTS and the MTS <a href="publictransport1.html">(Click here for more information about public transportation)</a>, and they have machine in English to purchase tickets) so 2 different train later we arrived at the station that was the closest to our place. There’s were we took a wonderful decision, lets walk to there, with our backpacks 30h of flight, 3 h at the airport and 1h of train in the heat for the first time… Lets just say that it wasn’t our brightest moment but it was doable. We wondered around a bit too because the address on google and the actual address of the place were not the same. We ended up using the picture of the street around the place to get there. Has soon has we arrived we wash and crash !</p>
