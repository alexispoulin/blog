                            We bought our ticket around 6 weeks in advance for the trip. First, we look on google for tickets the price looked good but continued our search just to be sure. For us Canadian it’s a 20h flight minimum… well you tries to do an informed purchase. I ended up on youtube on travelDan’s vlog about different airline. He swear that Qatar airway was one of the best and it was also the airline with the most leg room (Traveling with a 6 foot 6 bear that’s important). So we decided to book directly for the airline and bonus point it was 100$ cheaper than the price we found on google! <a href="fromto1.html">(If you want to know the detail of the flight, seat, meals and other please click here)</a>

So we left Montréal around noon and started our 30h trip (yeah 30h cause it’s cheaper that way…) with a 1h45 flight to philadelphie on American airline. Once we arrived in philadelphie we had to get out of the terminal and back in the check our ticket at the Qatar airway counter (we learned later that you can do that a the gate 1-2h before the flight but in our case we wanted to secure the emergency exit seat (click here to know more about Qatar emergency exit seat policy) 
And up we went on our 11h flight to Qatar (yes the country, all of the company flight layover in Qatar) and thanks to some night advil it went like a charm. (I highly recommend sleeping pill on long flight it guaranty a good sleep and therefore a short flight)

For our layover, we were advise by a flight attendant not to get out of the airport...we didn’t have the time to but if you do have the time it’s not a recommended option. 
                <br>
                <br>
We finally arrived in Bangkok a 5h am local time, at the Bangkok airport you can use the regular lane to pass true immigration (ask the staff they are very helpful) For immigration since we are Canadian we have an automatic visa of 30 days (and we need to fill out a immigration card, for more information about visa please click here). The immigration office take your finger print and that’s about it. They don’t really ask you question so no worry! 
                <br>
                <br>
Once we pass emigration it’s still a little too early to go to our AirBnb that we booked (Here’s a link to a few useful site to book accommodation in Asia).  So we start by getting cash at an ATM with our credit Card (we always use the credit card for cash it’s safer that way…) but you need cash you cannot pay with credit card in Thailand (almost no where..) After money it was time for internet connection! There’s a lot of internet provided here’s a link to compare them. We got 15 G for around 20$ for 20 days not bad especially if you compare to Canadian price… It’s a bit more expensive to  get the plan and sim card at the airport but by 2-3 $. Finally time to eat breakfast witch didn’t look like one ! (For those going the the Bangkok international airport, go downstairs to eat, there’s a food court there. Way way cheaper than the upstairs restaurant. And yes we are going to feel like you are going in the wrong direction but it’s fine. Also they use ticket, so at the entrance of the food court you need to buy the ticket, then buy your meal.) In our case you choose soups and fruit shakes. The soup was good but I still have doubt about what was in it…  and the fruit shake well we had one almost everyday starting from there.

Now we have kill enough time and it’s time to go to our guest house in …… , it’s a less touristy area of Bangkok. We decided to take the train (Bangkok have the BTS and the MTS, and they have machine in English to purchase tickets) so 2 different train later we arrived at the station that was the closest to our place. There’s were we took a wonderful decision, lets walk to there, with our backpacks 30h of flight, 3 h at the airport and 1h of train in the heat for the first time… Lets just say that it wasn’t our brightest moment but it was doable. We wondered around a bit too because the address on google and the actual address of the place were not the same. We ended up using the picture of the street around the place to get there. Has soon has we arrived we wash and crash !</p>
