                            <p>
For this flight, I use Qatar airline to get from Montreal (Pierre-Elliott Trudeau - YUL) to Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi airport - BKK). It took us 30h and 3 flight to get there (to be honest, from Canada, you don’t really have a choice for the length of the travel… it’s a far far away land)
<br>
<br>
<b>Pricing</b> <br>
It cost us 670$(CAD) per ticket, regular ticket with no prefere seat, one-way. I am going to explain later what does those plane ticket included. If you want to land in a different city, for example Chiang mai it may cost you a little more (Ex: Chiang Mai it’s was 100$ more) 
<br>
<br>
<b>Booking</b><br>
We booked directly from the airline website<br> <a href=”https://www.qatarairways.com/en-us/homepage.html”> https://www.qatarairways.com/en-us/homepage.html</a><br>
The company didn’t have flight leaving directly from Montreal but they do book flight from other company to transit you to one of their landing port. In our case, that meant a 1h45 flight to Philadelphia on American airway. (They seem to make sure that the airline they use to transit you have the same level of comfort and the same amount of luggage permitted on flight, but you can check beforehand)<br>
Once we have selected the departure date, they gave us more options for that date (on the top of the page they also give the lowest price possible for other dates…it helps a lot if you are flexible and on a budget) We booked our ticket around 5 weeks in advance. This is what seems to be the sweet spot to get the lowest price possible. After we had booked online, the company sent us an E-Ticket (from that email we could select seat and choose a prefered meal). We did print everything just to make sure and had a pdf copy our phone so we didn’t had any problem at the airport (you never know… and gabby is a stressed human with electronic device) 
<br>
<br>
<b>Amenities on flight</b><br>
For the American Airways’ flight, we got a small snack and a choice of non alcoholic beverage for free. The legroom was good but I got to admit that Alexis with his 6,6 length was a bit tight) 
<br>
<br>
For both of the Qatar Airways’ flight, we were fed a lot… First flight, we got a dinner, a midnight snack  that I slept through (don’t worry they wake you up for the main meals and they do a second round) and a breakfast. The second fight we took with Qatar was shorter but we still got a meal and a snack. All of those were served with jus, water and a choice of alcoholic drink for free (yes alcohol on flight for free and has much has you want). (You can always pass and ask for water or drink to the stewardess they are really helpful). Now the leg room, the regular seat had a lot of legroom (enough for alexis) but we didn’t experience those. Due to Alexis size they gave us the emergency exit seat which had no front seat so he had enough room to stretch. (you still have your personal TV hidden in the armrest). I will explained later how you can get those seat. Last and not least, waiting for us on our seat on each of the qatar airway flight, was a bag of goodies. That bag contained toothbrush, toothpaste, earplug, earphone and an eye mask to sleep. On the seat, you also had a pillow and a blanket. The second flight only had the pillow and blanket but it was a short flight. With all of those thing, I was able to enjoy much more than I thought and slept well. (No, I am not paid by Qatar, I wish, but no)
<br>
<br>
<b>Emergency seat</b><br>
Here’s the trick, most of the time, you cannot book or reserved them in advance. You can only ask for them at the counter and it's the employee that chooses the person who gets them. You must be an adult and speak english (in case of emergency you are in charge of the door and they take that very seriously). In our case, we didn’t had to ask for them, they saw alexis and proposed them to us (For both of the flight!), but if you arrive late they may not be available anymore. General rule of thumb, arrive early if you have a lengthy problem named Alexis. 
<br>
<br>
With all of that don’t forget your passport and your good to go!
