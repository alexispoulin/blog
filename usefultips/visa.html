                                    Before you leave for a country, always verify with the official visa agency of that

                                    to changes. Please verify with your official visa agency.</i>
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                As a canadian in thailand, we have an automatic visa of 30 days for free. It comes in
                                the form of an horizontal paper card that the flight attendant gives mid-air and that
                                you need to fill out before touching the ground. You will present this card filled out
                                to the immigration officer at the airport. They will stamp it and will give back to you
                                a smaller part of that paper. Don’t lose it, you need to give it back when you leave the
                                country (If you do lose it, they will just give you a new one to fill out, so no real
                                worry)
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                If you stay longer than 30 days, you may get arrested. Let me explain, if you stay a few
                                days longer, try not to encounter the police and head the airport to leave, the
                                immigration officer won’t arrest you. But if you get arrest by a police officer for
                                various real or unreal reason and they ask to see your passport…. you will get arrested
                                and will have a fine if you have overstay your visa. If you want to stay longer you have
                                three option.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                1) Before entering the country, ask for a longer visa via the proper channels.
                                <br>
                                2) Once you have entered the country go to an official counter and extend your visa (for
                                a small fee)
                                <br>
                                3) Leave and re-enter the country… Yeah it works and there’s a business around it. There
                                are some traveling agency that have a “visa-run” package. They get you out of the
                                country in their van/car and get back in a few hours later. It’s all perfectly legal,
                                they won't bother if you do it once but don’t try to do it 6 times…. they will notice
                                and refuse you the entry.

                                Has Canadians (also valid for US citizen), we have an automatic visa of 90 days
                                upon arrival. You will need to fill out a small paper. Normally the stewardess
                                will give you one on board. We then presented it to the immigration officer and
                                he took our fingerprints and it was done.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                You can also fill out the paper online and they will have it at your arrival. We
                                didn’t use that method, it was the immigration officer that inform us of that
                                system. They want us to use it in order to save some paper and trees.

                                <h2><br>Visa - Indonesia </h2>
                                <p>

                                    For indonesia you have two options as a Canadian tourist. The
                                    automatic non extendable 30 days visa or the 30 days extendable
                                    visa.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <b>Non extendable</b><br>
                                    For that one it’s easy you fill out the form they give you at the
                                    airport (like in most airports). At the gate they will give you a 30
                                    days visa. Importante note: They are not kidding with the 30 days no
                                    extending... Don’t overstay. If you are not sure of the length of
                                    your stay, use the 30 days extendable visa
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <b>Extendable</b><br>
                                    We didn’t use that one but because it requires you to apply in
                                    advance. It cannot be requested at the border. There is also a small
                                    fee. Of course if you want to extend you need to pay another fee.
                                    But it’s still less expensive than ending up in an indonesian
                                    prison…

                                    With a Canadian passport we had a 30 days automatic visa when we showed up
                                    at the border. No planning in advance needed.

                                    If you enter the country with a 30 days visa but decided that you want or
                                    need to stay longer, you can go to an immigration office an request an
                                    extension. They will charge you a fee and extended your stay. (they didn’t
                                    specified for how long… maybe they have different fee according to the
                                    length of the extension)

                                    If you know you are going to stay for more than 30 days in the philippines
                                    you can request a longer visa in advance. From what we heard it’s not a
                                    complicated thing to request visa in the Philippines. There’s a lot of
                                    foreigners living there “permanently”.

                                    <b>Getting Them </b>
                                    <br>
                                    To get a vietnamese visa you need to apply by mail or via internet. We used the
                                    internet option. First thing to mention is: No, those website are not scams. There
                                    are no official platform to request a vietnamese visa, you have to obtain them
                                    directly through a third party. That vendor will request the visa for you and send
                                    you the paperwork a few days later. You need to print the paper work before arriving
                                    to the airport.. the agencies will charge you a fee plus de initial cost of the
                                    visa. You will still have to pay the visa at the airport upon arrival for the
                                    pictures. In our case we chose this website <a href="https://vietnamvisa.govt.vn/">
                                        https://vietnamvisa.govt.vn/ </a> and select the 21 days option which costed 34$
                                    USD for both. If you want you can pay more and get it faster or for a longer period
                                    of time. You need to enter the dates of arrival AND departure otherwise they won’t
                                    let you in the country if you don’t know when you leave. In our case we were
                                    arriving around midnight.. which was a thought call to determine if we were going to
                                    land on the 15th of october or the 16th. We decided to be safe and request a visa
                                    for the 15th of october.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    <b>At the airport</b>
                                    <br>
                                    You need to have the documents printed when you arrive at the airport. (By documents
                                    I mean the documents stating your visa approval that the company will have sent
                                    you). At the airport you can withdraw money to pay for the visa. You need vietnamese
                                    dong to pay the visa. You will need to find the counter (it’s on the right when you
                                    arrived at the custom) Once you talk with the officer he will give you a form to
                                    fill out and you will need to give back to him afterward. you will also need to give
                                    them your paperwork from the agency and your passport. If you have a passport size
                                    picture with you, the visa will cost less but if you don’t, like us, they pass your
                                    passport through a software that transpose the photo in your passport on the visa
                                    application. After awhile they called our names and gave us our passport back with a
                                    vietnamese visa in! You are then ready to pass immigration.

                                    <b>Options</b>
                                    <br>
                                    For visa you have a few length different for your stay up to a year from what I have
                                    seen. Each of them have different price varying from around 25$ to 200$. You always
                                    have two options when you get a visa. One is with one entry and the other one is
                                    with as much in and out as you want. Let me explain with the one entry, you only get
                                    to get in the country once. So if you get out you will need a new visa even if your
                                    visa isn’t expired. If you get an unlimited than you can get out and back in as much
                                    as you want as long as your visa is valid.. Of course the price between the two
                                    option vary a lot (double from what I have seen). Remember all the information about
                                    visa are for canadien, they may not apply if you are from an another country.
